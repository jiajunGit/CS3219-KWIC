Rules for the KWIC system:

1) Duplicate input lines will not be removed because KWIC is a system that allows search for keywords in each line (each line is thus unique)

2) lines generated from shifts with have any lines with a stop word as its first word (keyword) removed

  e.g:

  Assume Fast is a stop word

  line 1:   Fast Fast Furious

  shifted:
  Fast Fast Furious <- discard
  Fast Furious Fast <- discard
  Furious Fast Fast <- keep

3) Lines generated from shifts using lines with duplicate words ( i.e Fast Fast Furious ) will have any lines with
   a duplicate first word (keyword) removed - rationale: KWIC allows user to search for unique keywords on each line

   e.g:
   Fast Fast Furious <- keep
   Fast Furious Fast <- discard
   Furious Fast Fast <- keep

4) Lines are sorted by the first word (keyword) only
